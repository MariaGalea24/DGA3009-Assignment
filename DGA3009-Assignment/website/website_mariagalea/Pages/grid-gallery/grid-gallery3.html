                    <h2>Personal Manifesto</h2>
                    <h3>School Photography Assignment.</h3>
                    <p> The project by the name “ Personal Manifesto “ aims to give the protagonist the opportunity to expose their story ,
                        making them boldly confront their presentment and their mistakes whilst uncovering their vulnerability and their raw
                        emotions. Once this is done , these emotions are transferred in a different atmosphere , an ambiance of acceptance.
                        The individual puts himself on a high pedestal , an altar , detaching himself from earth and its profanity while a
                        divine blue light sheds upon him/ her , enlightening their weaknesses and eventually leading his/her way to
                        acceptance. This was done in a studio , with 8 individual protagonist taking part. The first phase was the
                        documentation of their stories. The person was seated on a chair with one spot of light on him/ her. They were given
                        a choice , to either record their statement or either write it down on paper. The protagonist was given constant
                        pressure to dig deeper into his feelings by the use of questions. When they thought they let out everything they
                        wanted to , they moved on to the next phase of the session. The protagonist was asked to take off his clothes
                        symbolising his materialistic possessions and leaving them behind as he/ she moves on to climb up to the top of the
                        pedestal and embracing his/ her selves.</p>
